## Summary

Monomesh is a new branch of DigiBale Pty Ltd, specializing in the production and distribution of Helium compatible hotspots, trackers and sensors, targeting AgTech sector. Over the last 8 years DigiBale has been working solely in AgTech sector building and distributing trackers, sensors and monitoring devices for cattle, sheep, forestry and sugarcane industries.

## Company Information (required)
* What is your company name? MonoMesh
* How long has the company been in business? The mother company (DigiBale Pty Ltd) has been in business for 8 years, MonoMesh is created solely for Helium compatible device and hotspot market

* How many have you sold? 20k units +
* What brought you to the Helium Network? Workshops and research with farmers have indicated growing interest in wireless monitoring but most users are afraid of data cost through mobile broadband. Most farmers indicated, that they are more likely to set up trackers, gateways and sensors if there is an opportunity to offset the data cost by some means (mining helium)

## Product Information (required)
* What is this product's model name? (Hotspot models with different hardware will need a separate HIP19 application.) MonoMesh GW1
* Is this is a Light Hotspot or a 5G Hotspot? (Due to the time required for the HIP19 process, new applications should be for Light Hotspots or 5G Hotspots, 5G Hotspots may require additional information) Light Hotspot
* Is this model for indoor, outdoor, or both? (If there are two different models for indoor and outdoor, list them separately.) Both
* Provide a brief description of the product: Solar powered gateway, that has inbuilt LiPo cells for continuous operation. Can be also powered with 5V micro USB. Existing gateway without Helium support has been in production for the past 5 years.

## Hardware Security Element (required)
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured. The approved security element is an ECC608. If you would like to use an alternative security element your HIP19 will require additional review, please email the Helium Foundation (christina@helium.foundation).
* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or No? Yes
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or No? Yes
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No? Yes
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No? (Please note, the final design will be audited against this statement. Do not answer 'yes' unless the design will have these features and a description of where they are implemented can be provided.) Yes
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No? Yes

## Hardware Information (required) Please provide detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts.
Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos/videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better. 
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices?
This would includes remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise. 
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?  ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs.)  SX1302
* What is the CPU?
* Additional Hardware Specifications: 

## Manufacturing Information (required)
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
* Have you built gateways before? 
* How many gateways did you make? 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer or working with a partner? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure? 

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from the Helium Foundation. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives. Details for this will be provided after your application has been submitted on GitHub.

* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to?
